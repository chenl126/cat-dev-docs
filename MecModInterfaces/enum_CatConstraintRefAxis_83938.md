# CatConstraintRefAxis (Enumeration)

**_Constraint reference axis._**

Constraints that specify parallelism or perpendicularity to an axis in 3D are mono-element constraints. The axis to which the constraint applies is determined by the constraint property `ReferenceAxis`. This enum lists appropriate values to set this property.

**Values:**

` catCstRefAxisX`      The constraint applies to the X axis.
` catCstRefAxisY`      The constraint applies to the Y axis.
` catCstRefAxisZ`      The constraint applies to the Z axis.
