# NotWireBoundaryMonoDimFeatVertex (Object)

**_0-D boundary belonging to a feature whose topological result is one dimensional, the boundary not beeing the extremity of the feature._**

**Role** : This [Boundary](../MecModInterfaces/interface_Boundary_14542.md) object may be, for example, in a part containing a Sketch which is made up of a circle arc and a spline, the vertex between the circle arc and the spline. You will create a NotWireBoundaryMonoDimFeatVertex object using the [Shapes.GetBoundary](../MecModInterfaces/interface_Shapes_8122.htm#GetBoundary) , [HybridShapes.GetBoundary](../MecModInterfaces/interface_HybridShapes_30836.htm#GetBoundary) , [Sketches.GetBoundary](../MecModInterfaces/interface_Sketches_14228.htm#GetBoundary) or [Selection.SelectElement2](../InfInterfaces/interface_Selection_18040.htm#SelectElement2) method. Then, you pass it to the operator. The lifetime of a NotWireBoundaryMonoDimFeatVertex object is limited, see [Boundary](../MecModInterfaces/interface_Boundary_14542.md).
