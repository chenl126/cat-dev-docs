# CatConstraintMode (Enumeration)

**_Constraint working mode
Part constraints can work in two modes: as constraints or as measurements._**

In _constraint_ mode, the value assigned to the constraint drives the actual position of the constrained geometry.
In _measurement_ mode, the constraint value only reflects what can be observed from the actual position of the constrained geometry.

**Values:**

` catCstModeDrivingDimension`      Specifies that a constraint should work as a constraint.
` catCstModeDrivenDimension`      Specifies that a constraint should work as a measurement.
