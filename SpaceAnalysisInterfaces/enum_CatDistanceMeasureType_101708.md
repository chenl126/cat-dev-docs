# CatDistanceMeasureType (Enumeration)

**_The different types of distance measure._**
It is used by the [Distance](../SpaceAnalysisInterfaces/interface_Distance_13954.md) object to specify the measure type.

**Values:**

` catDistanceMeasureTypeMinimum`      The computation measures the minimum distance between products
` catDistanceMeasureTypeAlongX`      The computation measures the minimum distance along X between products
` catDistanceMeasureTypeAlongY`      The computation measures the minimum distance along Y between products
` catDistanceMeasureTypeAlongZ`      The computation measures the minimum distance along Z between products
` catDistanceMeasureTypeBand`      The computation analyses the band between products
